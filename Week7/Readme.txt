CMEECourseWork/Week7/
This directory is a main folder including 3 directories (Code, Data, results) and one file (Readme.txt), which contains relevant courseworks in Week 7.


CMEECourseWork/Week7/Code/ 
This directory is one of benches of Week7, which covers codes of courseworks as well as exercises listed in the Jupyter Notebook.
   --LV1.py: It is a file to plot the  numerical integration in Python for solving a classical model in biology — the Lotka-Volterra model for a predator-prey system in two-dimensional space (e.g., on land).
   --profileme.py:  an illustrative program to show profiling is easy in ipython
   --profileme2.py: converted the loop to a list comprehension, and replaced the .join with an explicit string concatenation.
   --timeitme.py: It shows you can use the timeit module if you want to figure out what the best way to do something specific as part of a larger program (say a particular command or a loop) might be.
   --LV2.py: It runs the Lotka-Volterra model with prey density dependence rR(1−RK)
   --run_LV.py:testing LV1,2,3,4.py
   --LV3.py: Write a discrete-time version of the LV model called LV3.py. 
   --LV4.py: Write a version of the discrete-time model simulation with a random gaussian fluctuation in resource's growth rate at each time-step
   --DrawFW.py: code for plotting a food web network in a program file
   --regexs.py: show Regex functions in python 
   --blackbirds.py: Blackbirds problem
   --TestR.R: test for running R from Python easily
   --TestR.py:to run R
   --using_os.py: one of exercise
   --fmr.R: used for testing,one of exercise
   --run_fmr_R.py: test for running fmr.R
