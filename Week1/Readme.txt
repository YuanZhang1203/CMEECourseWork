The hash marks in the following lines tell the interpreter that it should ignore the lines following them (that's how you put in script documentation (who wrote the script and when, what the script does, etc.) and comments on particular line of script.
Note that there is a commented out exit command at the end of the script. Uncommenting it will not change the behavior of the script, but will allow you to generate a error code, and if the command is inserted in the middle of the script, to stop the code at that point.
