CMEECourseWork/Week2/Code/
This folder contain python codes of practices in Week2.
    --align_seqs.py: It is a file collected from TheMulQuaBio's code directory.It has a function that computes a score by returning the number of matches of two sequences.It could be use to see the numbers of matches of two DNA sequences.
    --basic_csv.py: It shows how to read a file.
    --basic_io1.py: It shows the basic python input/output, using if and for.
    --basic_io2.py: It shows how to save the elements of a list to a file.
    --basic_io3.py: It is used to save an object (even complex) for later use
    --boilerplate.py: It is a  "boilerplate" program.
    --cfexercises1.py: It is a script modified by control-flow-tools.
    --cfexercises2.py: It shows loops and conditionals combined. 
    --config.py:  It shows "global" variables are visible inside and outside of functions. Global variables could be assigned. 
    --control_flow.py: A copy of boilerplate.py. It shows s program-with-control-flows.
    --debugme.py: It is a file to show how to debug.
    --dictionary.py: It is a practice to list the dictionary.
    --lc1.py:It is a practice to list the different types respectively.
    --lc2.py: It is a practice to list the elements that are meet requirements.
    --loops.py: It shows loops in python.
    --MyScript.py: It is used for Running Python scripts, same as basic_io1.py.
    --oaks_debugme.py: It is a practice to find and modify the bugs.
    --oaks.py: It shows how to finds those taxa that are oak trees from a list of species.
    --scope.py: It shows "global" variables are visible inside and outside of functions.Global variables could be assigned. 
    --sysargv.py: It shows how to use sys.argv.  sys.argv is simply an object created by python using the sys module that contains the names of the argument variables in the current script.
    --test_control_flow.py: It is a test file to show the control folw.
    --tuple.py: It is a practice to list the species respectively.
    --using_name.py: It shows having __name__ = "__main__" makes the interpreter assign the string "__main__" to the __name__ variable, so that the your module execution starts with the control flow first passing through
the main function.


CMEECourseWork/Week2/Data/
This folder contain python relevant data of practices in Week2.
    --bodymass.csv: It shows different body mass of different species.
    --DNASequences.txt: It list two DNA sequences.
    --JustOaksData.csv: It is an output file from TestOaksData.csv by oaks_debugme.py. 
    --testcsv.csv: It shows that the csv package makes it easy to manipulate CSV files.
    --TestOaksData.csv: It is a file to debug(file lacking) the oaks_debugme.py.
